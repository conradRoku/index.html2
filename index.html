        <h5>I'm a 22-year-old cook living in Santa Monica. I just injured my foot, causing permanent damage.
            I'am unable to be a cook as a result and am now getting into web development. I learn remarkable fast and able to adapt to any situation.
            I really enjoy solving all the problems that programming has to offer. It's kind of like a puzzel to me.</h5>
        <h3>experance</h3>
        <h5>I graduated high school early and then went onto culinary school for a year before covid hit, during which I lost my job
             and schooling at the same time. After covid restrictions started to lift, I moved to LA and started cooking again, until now.</h5>
